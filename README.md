# AO Computer

AO Computer is a highly parallel computing system designed to provide reliable and collaborative computing services that can evolve indefinitely

Key features of AO include parallel processing, unlimited computation, interaction with Arweave, autonomous processes, and modular design.

For more information read this thread https://x.com/0x_Rorschach/status/1770138088137723986?s=20

The platform enables autonomous interaction with Arweave and allows users to earn CRED, the native currency of the AO testnet, by completing community quests.

First we will try to configure our environment, Then started the first quest together.

# Getting started

Installs NVM (Node Version Manager)
```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```
Download and install Node.js
```shell
nvm install 20
```
Verifies the right Node.js version is in the environment
```shell
node -v # should print `v20.***`
```
Verifies the right NPM version is in the environment
```shell
npm -v # should print `10.***`
```
